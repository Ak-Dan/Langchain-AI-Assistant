The LLMRouterChain routed an input query to one of multiple destinations-- that is, given an input query, it used a LLM to select from a list of destination chains, and passed its inputs to the selected chain.
LLMRouterChain does not support common chat model features, such as message roles and tool calling. Under the hood, LLMRouterChain routes a query by instructing the LLM to generate JSON-formatted text, and parsing out the intended destination.
Consider an example from a MultiPromptChain, which uses LLMRouterChain. Below is an (example) default prompt:
from langchain.chains.router.multi_prompt import MULTI_PROMPT_ROUTER_TEMPLATEdestinations = """animals: prompt for animal expertvegetables: prompt for a vegetable expert"""router_template = MULTI_PROMPT_ROUTER_TEMPLATE.format(destinations=destinations)print(router_template.replace("`", "'"))  # for rendering purposes
Given a raw text input to a language model select the model prompt best suited for the input. You will be given the names of the available prompts and a description of what the prompt is best suited for. You may also revise the original input if you think that revising it will ultimately lead to a better response from the language model.<< FORMATTING >>Return a markdown code snippet with a JSON object formatted to look like:'''json{{    "destination": string \ name of the prompt to use or "DEFAULT"    "next_inputs": string \ a potentially modified version of the original input}}'''REMEMBER: "destination" MUST be one of the candidate prompt names specified below OR it can be "DEFAULT" if the input is not well suited for any of the candidate prompts.REMEMBER: "next_inputs" can just be the original input if you don't think any modifications are needed.<< CANDIDATE PROMPTS >>animals: prompt for animal expertvegetables: prompt for a vegetable expert<< INPUT >>{input}<< OUTPUT (must include '''json at the start of the response) >><< OUTPUT (must end with ''') >>
Most of the behavior is determined via a single natural language prompt. Chat models that support tool calling features confer a number of advantages for this task:

Supports chat prompt templates, including messages with system and other roles;
Tool-calling models are fine-tuned to generate structured output;
Support for runnable methods like streaming and async operations.

Now let's look at LLMRouterChain side-by-side with an LCEL implementation that uses tool-calling. Note that for this guide we will langchain-openai >= 0.1.20:
%pip install -qU langchain-core langchain-openai
