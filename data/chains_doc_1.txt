AgentRelease policySecurity PolicyVersionsMigrating from v0.0 chainsMigrating from ConstitutionalChainOn this pageMigrating from ConstitutionalChain
ConstitutionalChain allowed for a LLM to critique and revise generations based on principles, structured as combinations of critique and revision requests. For example, a principle might include a request to identify harmful content, and a request to rewrite the content.
Constitutional AI principles are based on the Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback paper.
In ConstitutionalChain, this structure of critique requests and associated revisions was formatted into a LLM prompt and parsed out of string responses. This is more naturally achieved via structured output features of chat models. We can construct a simple chain in LangGraph for this purpose. Some advantages of this approach include:

Leverage tool-calling capabilities of chat models that have been fine-tuned for this purpose;
Reduce parsing errors from extracting expression from a string LLM response;
Delegation of instructions to message roles (e.g., chat models can understand what a ToolMessage represents without the need for additional prompting);
Support for streaming, both of individual tokens and chain steps.

DetailsBelow, we use the .with_structured_output method to simultaneously generate (1) a judgment of whether a critique is needed, and (2) the critique. We surface all prompts involved for clarity and ease of customizability.Note that we are also able to stream intermediate steps with this implementation, so we can monitor and if needed intervene during its execution.from typing import List, Optional, Tuplefrom langchain.chains.constitutional_ai.models import ConstitutionalPrinciplefrom langchain.chains.constitutional_ai.prompts import (    CRITIQUE_PROMPT,    REVISION_PROMPT,)from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParserfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplatefrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAIfrom langgraph.graph import END, START, StateGraphfrom typing_extensions import Annotated, TypedDictllm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")class Critique(TypedDict):    """Generate a critique, if needed."""    critique_needed: Annotated[bool, ..., "Whether or not a critique is needed."]    critique: Annotated[str, ..., "If needed, the critique."]critique_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(    "Critique this response according to the critique request.
