StuffDocumentsChain combines documents by concatenating them into a single context window. It is a straightforward and effective strategy for combining documents for question-answering, summarization, and other purposes.
create_stuff_documents_chain is the recommended alternative. It functions the same as StuffDocumentsChain, with better support for streaming and batch functionality. Because it is a simple combination of LCEL primitives, it is also easier to extend and incorporate into other LangChain applications.
Below we will go through both StuffDocumentsChain and create_stuff_documents_chain on a simple example for illustrative purposes.
Let's first load a chat model:

Select chat model:Google Gemini‚ñæOpenAIAnthropicAzureGoogle GeminiGoogle VertexAWSGroqCohereNVIDIAFireworks AIMistral AITogether AIIBM watsonxDatabricksxAIPerplexityDeepSeekChatOCIGenAIpip install -qU "langchain[google-genai]"import getpassimport osif not os.environ.get("GOOGLE_API_KEY"):  os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter API key for Google Gemini: ")from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_modelllm = init_chat_model("gemini-2.5-flash", model_provider="google_genai")
Example‚Äã
Let's go through an example where we analyze a set of documents. We first generate some simple documents for illustrative purposes:
from langchain_core.documents import Documentdocuments = [    Document(page_content="Apples are red", metadata={"title": "apple_book"}),    Document(page_content="Blueberries are blue", metadata={"title": "blueberry_book"}),    Document(page_content="Bananas are yelow", metadata={"title": "banana_book"}),]API Reference:Document
Legacy‚Äã
DetailsBelow we show an implementation with StuffDocumentsChain. We define the prompt template for a summarization task and instantiate a LLMChain object for this purpose. We define how documents are formatted into the prompt and ensure consistency among the keys in the various prompts.from langchain.chains import LLMChain, StuffDocumentsChainfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, PromptTemplate# This controls how each document will be formatted. Specifically,# it will be passed to `format_document` - see that function for more# details.document_prompt = PromptTemplate(    input_variables=["page_content"], template="{page_content}")document_variable_name = "context"# The prompt here should take as an input variable the# `document_variable_name`prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("Summarize this content: {context}")llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)chain = StuffDocumentsChain(    llm_chain=llm_chain,    document_prompt=document_prompt,    document_variable_name=document_variable_name,)API Reference:ChatPromptTemplate | PromptTemplateWe can now invoke our chain:result = chain.invoke(documents)result["output_text"]'This content describes the colors of different fruits: apples are red, blueberries are blue, and bananas are yellow.'for chunk in chain.stream(documents):    print(chunk){'input_documents': [Document(metadata={'title': 'apple_book'}, page_content='Apples are red'), Document(metadata={'title': 'blueberry_book'}, page_content='Blueberries are blue'), Document(metadata={'title': 'banana_book'}, page_content='Bananas are yelow')], 'output_text': 'This content describes the colors of different fruits: apples are red, blueberries are blue, and bananas are yellow.'}

DetailsBelow we show an implementation using create_stuff_documents_chain:from langchain.chains.combine_documents import create_stuff_documents_chainfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplateprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("Summarize this content: {context}")chain = create_stuff_documents_chain(llm, prompt)API Reference:ChatPromptTemplateInvoking the chain, we obtain a similar result as before:result = chain.invoke({"context": documents})result'This content describes the colors of different fruits: apples are red, blueberries are blue, and bananas are yellow.'Note that this implementation supports streaming of output tokens:for chunk in chain.stream({"context": documents}):    print(chunk, end=" | ") | This |  content |  describes |  the |  colors |  of |  different |  fruits | : |  apples |  are |  red | , |  blue | berries |  are |  blue | , |  and |  bananas |  are |  yellow | . |  |
