The RetrievalQA chain performed natural-language question answering over a data source using retrieval-augmented generation.
Some advantages of switching to the LCEL implementation are:

Easier customizability. Details such as the prompt and how documents are formatted are only configurable via specific parameters in the RetrievalQA chain.
More easily return source documents.
Support for runnable methods like streaming and async operations.

Now let's look at them side-by-side. We'll use the following ingestion code to load a blog post by Lilian Weng on autonomous agents into a local vector store:
Shared setup‚Äã
For both versions, we'll need to load the data with the WebBaseLoader document loader, split it with RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, and add it to an in-memory FAISS vector store.
We will also instantiate a chat model to use.
