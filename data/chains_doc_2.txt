ConversationChain incorporated a memory of previous messages to sustain a stateful conversation.
Some advantages of switching to the Langgraph implementation are:

Innate support for threads/separate sessions. To make this work with ConversationChain, you'd need to instantiate a separate memory class outside the chain.
More explicit parameters. ConversationChain contains a hidden default prompt, which can cause confusion.
Streaming support. ConversationChain only supports streaming via callbacks.

Langgraph's checkpointing system supports multiple threads or sessions, which can be specified via the "thread_id" key in its configuration parameters.
