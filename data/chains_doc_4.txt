LLMChain combined a prompt template, LLM, and output parser into a class.
Some advantages of switching to the LCEL implementation are:

Clarity around contents and parameters. The legacy LLMChain contains a default output parser and other options.
Easier streaming. LLMChain only supports streaming via callbacks.
Easier access to raw message outputs if desired. LLMChain only exposes these via a parameter or via callback.
