The MultiPromptChain routed an input query to one of multiple LLMChains-- that is, given an input query, it used a LLM to select from a list of prompts, formatted the query into the prompt, and generated a response.
MultiPromptChain does not support common chat model features, such as message roles and tool calling.
A LangGraph implementation confers a number of advantages for this problem:

Supports chat prompt templates, including messages with system and other roles;
Supports the use of tool calling for the routing step;
Supports streaming of both individual steps and output tokens.

Now let's look at them side-by-side. Note that for this guide we will langchain-openai >= 0.1.20

The orange variety is the most popular and widely recognized.'}In the LangSmith trace we can see the two steps of this process, including the prompts for routing the query and the final selected prompt.

The different colors often indicate varying flavors and nutritional profiles. For example, purple carrots contain anthocyanins, while orange carrots are rich in beta-carotene, which is converted to vitamin A in the body.In the LangSmith trace we can see the tool call that routed the query and the prompt that was selected to generate the answer.
Overview:​

Under the hood, MultiPromptChain routed the query by instructing the LLM to generate JSON-formatted text, and parses out the intended destination. It took a registry of string prompt templates as input.
The LangGraph implementation, implemented above via lower-level primitives, uses tool-calling to route to arbitrary chains. In this example, the chains include chat model templates and chat models.
